# test report
A test report is a document or output generated after running tests that provides information about the results of those tests. It typically includes details on whether the tests passed or failed, what was tested, and sometimes the coverage of the code that was exercised during the tests. Test reports help developers and teams to track the quality of their code and identify issues or defects early in the development process.

## Key Components of a Test Report:

## .1 Summary of Test Results:
1.A high-level overview of the test results, including:
2.Number of tests executed.
3.Number of tests that passed, failed, or were skipped.
4.Percentage of successful tests.

## .2 Detailed Test Case Results:
1.Information about each individual test case:
2.Test name or description.
3.Status (Passed/Failed/Skipped).
4.Execution time.
5.Error messages or stack traces for failed tests.

## 3.Code Coverage:
A code coverage report (if generated) that shows how much of the application’s code was executed during testing.
It helps in identifying untested parts of the codebase.

## 4. Test Execution Time:
1.How long each test took to run.
2.A total time for the entire test suite.

## 5.Environment Details:
Information about the environment where the tests were executed, including:
OS, browser version (if applicable), dependencies, etc.

## 6. Logs and Output:
Any logs, debug output, or console output generated during the test runs.


# Adding a Code Coverage Report
A code coverage report measures how much of your code is executed during testing. It helps ensure that important parts of your application are covered by tests, reducing the likelihood of bugs or untested edge cases.

## Add the coverage option in your package.json file:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --coverage"
  }
}
```

File       | % Stmts    | % Branch     |  Line #s   | Uncovered
---------- | :--------- | :----------: | ----------:|     0
All files  |     100    |      100     |     100    |     0
 select.js |     100    |      100     |     100    |

## Why 100% Code Coverage Is Not Always Possible (or Even Desirable)
Although achieving high code coverage is useful, aiming for 100% code coverage is not only difficult but also can be counterproductive.

1. Testing Everything ≠ Testing Well
Just because a line of code is covered doesn't mean that all its edge cases and potential errors are handled.
You can write tests that touch every line of code but miss out on important edge cases, complex logic, or integration scenarios.
2. Some Code is Hard to Test
Code that deals with external systems (e.g., databases, APIs) or platform-specific behaviors (e.g., OS-dependent code) is often difficult to fully test in an automated environment.
Mocking or faking such dependencies may not fully represent the real-world scenarios they are designed for.
3. Code with Side Effects
Code that performs side effects (like network requests or hardware interactions) is not always practical to test thoroughly.
Achieving 100% coverage here often involves writing tests that either aren't meaningful or that artificially inflate coverage without improving code quality.
4. Diminishing Returns
After a certain point, the cost of adding tests (to cover minor edge cases or exception handling) may outweigh the benefits.
Writing tests for trivial getters/setters, logging, or defensive programming constructs doesn’t usually provide significant value.
5. False Sense of Security
100% code coverage can create a false impression that the code is bug-free. Bugs can still exist in well-covered code if the tests are not properly designed to catch them.
6. Complex and Dead Code
Dead code (i.e., code that is unreachable) still counts against coverage, but trying to cover dead code is futile.
Complex conditional logic or dynamically generated code might also be extremely challenging to test fully.
Summary
High coverage (e.g., 80-90%) is good for catching issues early.
100% code coverage may involve diminishing returns, false confidence, and an unnecessary focus on unimportant parts of the code.
