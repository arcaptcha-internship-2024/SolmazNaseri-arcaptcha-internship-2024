# Time Complexity Analysis of the select Function
The select function implements a randomized shuffle algorithm to select a subset of elements from an input array. Let's break down its time complexity analysis:

1. Mapping operation:
Time complexity: O(m), where m is the length of the original array

2. Sorting operation:
Time complexity: O(m log m)
The sort function uses a stable sort algorithm 
3. Second mapping operation:
Time complexity: O(m)
4. Slicing operation:
Time complexity: O(k), where k is the number of elements selected
## Overall time complexity
The overall time complexity of the select function is dominated by the sorting operation. Therefore, the time complexity is:

O(m log m)

Where m is the length of the original array.
